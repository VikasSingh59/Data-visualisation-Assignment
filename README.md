# Data-visualisation-Assignment

Data Visualization is an important part of business activities as organizations nowadays collect a huge amount of data. Sensors all over the world are collecting climate data, user data through clicks, car data for prediction of steering wheels etc. All of these data collected hold key insights for businesses and visualizations make these insights easy to interpret.

Why are visualizations important?
Visualizations are the easiest way to analyze and absorb information. Visuals help to easily understand the complex problem. They help in identifying patterns, relationships, and outliers in data. It helps in understanding business problems better and quickly. It helps to build a compelling story based on visuals. Insights gathered from the visuals help in building strategies for businesses.

Data visualizations in python can be done via many packages. Weâ€™ll be discussing of matplotlib package. It can be used in Python scripts, Jupyter notebook, and web application servers.

Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a 2-D plotting library that helps in visualizing figures. Matplotlib emulates Matlab like graphs and visualizations. Matlab is not free, is difficult to scale and as a programming language is tedious. So, matplotlib in Python is used as it is a robust, free and easy library for data visualization.

Things to follow
Plotting of Matplotlib is quite easy. Generally, while plotting they follow the same steps in each and every plot. Matplotlib has a module called pyplot which aids in plotting figure. The Jupyter notebook is used for running the plots. We import matplotlib.pyplot as plt for making it call the package module.
1) plt.plot()for plotting line chart similarly in place of plot other functions are used for plotting. All plotting functions require data and it is provided in the function through parameters.
2) plot.xlabel , plt.ylabel for labeling x and y-axis respectively.
3) plt.xticks , plt.yticks for labeling x and y-axis observation tick points respectively.
4) plt.legend() for signifying the observation variables.
5) plt.title() for setting the title of the plot.
6) plot.show() for displaying the plot.
